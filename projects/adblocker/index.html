      <p>A collection of scripts that use /etc/hosts to block advertising-related,
      tracking, and malicious domains. Support for POSIX compatible shells and
      Windows Powershell. </p>
      <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>In short, adblocker takes these steps to block unwanted domains via
        the /etc/hosts file:
        <ol>
          <li>backs up the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file as <code>/etc/hosts.bk</code></li>
          <li><code>wgets</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">
          StevenBlack's Unified Hosts Filter</a></li>
          <li>adds additional filters for reddit's tracking domains</li>
        </ol>
        This is all achieved in 23 lines of commented and formatted code.</p>
      <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>One of my friends on the interwebz talked about how he made his own
        little adblocker that utilized the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to block
        advertizing/malvertizing/tracking domains. Pretty cool. He told me to
        make my own. Great. That's gonna turn out well.</p>
      <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I had no idea how to do this. I looked at some tutorials and stumbled
        upon a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cupoflinux.com/fusion/articles.php?article_id=34">
        Cup of Linux post</a>. Ok, nice. Unfortunately, it didn't work for some
        reason. Or maybe I knew nothing about anything at the time. Right, so
        time to roll my own solution.</p>
        <p>Couldn't be that hard, right? So, as my first forray into shell
        scripting, I wrote the script and made a post on the Linux Master Race
        subreddit. That gave me <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DonutDeflector/adblocker/stargazers">
        a few stars</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DonutDeflector/adblocker/graphs/contributors">
        two contributors</a>. Not to bad.</p>
        <p>This project was a pretty good learning experience, albeit a bit
        short. I was able to have my first experience working with contributors
        and learn more about git and GitHub. I also learned a few coding
        conventions regarding shell scripts. Overall, tons of fun.</p>
        <p class="footnote">* I didn't use this language myself, a
        contributor implemented a feature using the language.</p>
