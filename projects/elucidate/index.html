      <p>A nonmalicious Python script that uses basic methods to crack
      passwords.</p>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">NOTE: THIS SCRIPT IS NONMALICIOUS. ELUCIDATE
      ONLY CRACKS PASSWORDS THAT ARE SPECIFIED WITHIN THE SCRIPT AS VARIABLES.</p>
      <p>Based off a script created by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/Files/5549/17/crack2.py">
      Science Buddies</a>.</p>
      <p>This script contains cleaner, improved code and commenting as well as
      additional functionality.</p>
      <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>Elucidate uses 4 methods to crack passwords:</p>
        <h5>1. Dictionary of Common Passwords</h5>
          <p>Elucidate will use the <code>password.txt</code> file to guess the
          password. It contains only safe-for-work (and school) common passwords
          from a book called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Passwords-Selection-Protection-Authentication/dp/1597490415">
          Perfect Passwords: Selection, Protection, Authenication</a> by Mark
          Burnett (<b>ISBN 978-1597490412</b>).</p>
        <h5>2. Dictionary of Common Passwords (Plus Plus)</h5>
          <p>This builds upon the the first method. It combines two common
          passwords together, does the same with punctuation seperating the two,
          and capitalizes the first letters of each word.</p>
        <h5>3. Numbers Only</h5>
          <p>The script will guess the password only using numbers. It will
          first guess 1 number, then 2 number combinations, then 3 number
          combinations, etc. It will guess up to 8 digit numbers.</p>
        <h5>4. Combination of Characters</h5>
          <p>Elucidate will combine all characters and punctiation sequentially.
          It will first guess 1 character, then 2 character combinations , then
          3 character combinations, etc. It will guess combinations up to 25
          characters.</p>
      <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>It's the eight grade and I have to win the science fair before I get
        out of middle school. I unfortunately dishonored my family by getting
        second place the year prior. How was testing reaction times of hardcore
        gamers and casual gamers not awesome enough? I even made a slick video
        using Windows Movie Maker! That took at least 6 hours!</p>
        <p>Alright, how do I win back the honor of my family now? Super simple:
        do something vaguely 1337 H@XX0R. People are super impressed when
        anything involves a computer or stealing someone's python script.</p>
        <p>So what do hackers do? That's right. Crack passwords, use Tor, and
        cryptolocker hospital databases.</p>
        <p>How can I vaguely make this somewhat related to some field of
        science that is somehwat easy to explain to laypeople? Write (or modify)
        a Python script (Visual Basic was too hard) that cracks passwords
        (because Tor and cryptolockering would probably have me tackled by five
        NSA Agents instead of the usual three and be a pain to explain to the
        laypeople).</p>
      <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Luckily, Science Buddies did the bulk of the work. It wasn't too hard
        to make these modifications and it was a great way to learn about
        Python. Oh, and winning the science fair was cool to. I got a plastic
        trophy.</p>
        <h5>Modifications</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Clearer commenting</li>
            <li>More readable output to the terminal</li>
            <li>Removed need for password variables in MD5 Hashes</li>
            <li>Support for up to 10 passwords (from original 7)</li>
            <li>Support for up to 8 digit passwords (from original 7)</li>
            <li>Support for up to 25 character passwords (from original 8)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I spent some time looking through the code and looked for some
          low-hanging fruit to grab. It really helps when the tree is only two
          feet tall. All of these modifications were at the very lowest rung
          possible. Really, it mostly consisted of making things pretty, adding
          more slots in an array, and adding more variables.</p>
