        <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>One of my main focuses is front-end web devlopment.
          I'm very intersted in learning about new web technologies
          and implementing them in my projects. I find figuring out
          how to implement design elements using CSS and HTML to be
          quite fun.

        <h2>Blogging</h2>
          <p>I help run a technology blog called
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tekaholics.com">TEKaholics</a>. On the
          blog, I do organizational work, edit articles, and write
          my own posts. I found working on the blog to be very
          enjoyable. It allows me to help writers get their messages
          across and gives me a place to voice my thoughts.

        <h2>Piano</h2>
          <p>I started taking piano lessons five years ago. Often,
          after sitting at the piano, I find myself practicing for
          longer than intended. I play piano for my school choir
          and for a youth rock band, though I also enjoy playing
          pieces from the Classical and Romantic periods.
